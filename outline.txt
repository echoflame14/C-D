	//I want to make a text adventure game that will utilize traditional rpg elements
		// Elements like stats and saving throws.
			// I want the player to make choices
				// using dialog boxes
					// and example of this would be perception
						// the user could be given the prompt to notice certain aspects of their surroundings
							// such as
								// You look around, and notice:
									// a large ******* Per.chk 50%
									// a large ****** with a ******** in it's ******* PER.chk 20%
									// a *** Per.chk 80%
									// a brown shape in the distance per.chk 100%;
							// stats would start off all being 5
								// a succesfull chk would bump it up by .5 or 1 depending on the difficulty
								// a "lazy" chk would result in the stat being unchanged
		// I want the site to have one page (no navbars)
			// I want a sort of fantasy theme for the site
			// I want the feel of the site to change for the specific event that is happening in the story.
				// I think parallaxed css would help to immerse the player/user
					// I need to resherch parallax for this site
				// Such as the player getting hurt and the background-color changing to reflect it.
				// Or the screen darkening when the player enters a cave.
