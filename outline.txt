	//I want to make a text adventure game that will utilize traditional rpg elements
		// Elements like stats and saving throws.
			// I want the player to be able to choose which stats they want to allocate where.
		// I want the site to have one page (no navbars)
			// I want a sort of fantasy theme for the site
			// I want the feel of the site to change for the specific event that is happening in the story.
				// I think parallaxed css would help to immerse the player/user
					// I need to resherch parallax for this site
				// Such as the player getting hurt and the background-color changing to reflect it.
				// Or the screen darkening when the player enters a cave.
