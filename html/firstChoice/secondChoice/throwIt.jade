				h1 The Rock Flies..
				p You throw the rock back towards the river. You hear it plop into the water, you decide it was of no consecquence anyway. You turn to walk away from the stream when you hear a whirring sound, you turn in itâ€™s direction just in time to be struck in the face by the same strange rock. It is sucked into your open palm.
