        <p>Angry at the rock, you hurl it with all your might toward the river. You watch as it turns midflight and comes back at you with the same speed at wich you thew it. You brace yourself and cover your face.. Ouch! you exclaim as it hits your hands covering your face. It then slowly pushes itâ€™s self into your hand so that you find yourself holding the rock yet again..</p>
